Frankly, I write a lot of code in a lot of languages. There's a lot of
boilerplate, tools, and scripts I copy from project to project. Debugging,
coding, documentation, tests, etc all are quite similar in goal across projects
but differ wildly in implementation. I'd like to codify most of this so that,
when switching between projects, the cost of context switching isn't as painful.

Essentially, I do roughly the same activities regardless of platform or language.
This project is an experiment in solving the above problem.

Ideally it'd be sweet if this project would also manage my workstation as well
as my projects. Dotfiles, packages, etc. I'm tired of setting this shit up or
scripting it sideways every few months.

This project may end up looking a lot like an IDE plus some config management.
